# Application of graph theory in Markov Chain

This repository contains code for course project of IME625A.

Run main.py for analyzing Finite State Markov chain.

Input :
Transition matrix : transition.txt
Starting Distribution : start.txt

Output :
Communicating Blocks, Residual States, Standard/Canonical form of merged transition matrix, Expected number of visits before absorption, Hitting Probabilities, Stationary Distribution.


Run python PageRank.py to find top 10 pages from hollins.dat. This is the basic implementation of PageRank algorithm which uses the functions designed above.
